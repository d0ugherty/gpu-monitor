Nvidia GPU and Linux system monitor. 

I couldn't find an application that would monitor both system and GPU resource usage so I figured I'd make my own. 
There's probably something out there that works but the few applications I've tried didn't really do what I wanted, or just wouldn't read GPU information.

So, I figured this would be a practical and interesting way to learn C++ and some lower level programming.
